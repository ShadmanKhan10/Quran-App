    name: "Imam Abu Hanifa",
    description:
      "Imam Abu Hanifa was born in 699 CE in Kufa, Iraq. His full name was Numan ibn Thabit. He is recognized as the founder of the Hanafi school of thought, which eventually became the most widely followed among the four major Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence. Imam Abu Hanifa was known for his deep commitment to intellectual reasoning and legal deduction based on analogy. He placed great emphasis on using reason and personal judgment in areas where explicit guidance from the Quran and Hadith was not available. He was also a successful businessman who used his resources to support students and scholars. Imam Abu Hanifa studied under many distinguished teachers, including Imam Jafar al Sadiq, and was admired for his integrity and refusal to compromise on matters of justice. When offered high-ranking judicial positions by the ruling authorities, he refused to accept them, which led to his imprisonment and eventual death in 767 CE. The Hanafi school remains influential due to its systematic approach and adaptability to diverse social contexts.",

    name: "Imam Malik ibn Anas",
    description:
      "Imam Malik was born in 711 CE in the holy city of Medina. He is known as the founder of the Maliki school of thought, which is deeply rooted in the traditions of the people of Medina, the city where the Prophet Muhammad lived and taught. Imam Malik believed that the practices of the people of Medina represented the living tradition of the Prophet, and he treated those practices as authoritative sources of Islamic law. His most famous work, the Muwatta, is one of the earliest and most respected compilations of Hadith and legal opinions. Imam Malik was known for his deep knowledge, piety, and noble character. He taught thousands of students who spread his teachings across the Islamic world. Despite facing political challenges, Imam Malik maintained a dignified stance and avoided aligning himself with rulers, fearing that his rulings could be misused for political gain. He passed away in 795 CE. The Maliki school is especially prominent in North and West Africa and continues to guide many Muslims in their religious practices.",

    name: "Imam Muhammad ibn Idris al Shafi'i",
    description:
      "Imam Muhammad ibn Idris al Shafii was born in 767 CE in Gaza, Palestine. He later became one of the most influential scholars in Islamic history and is honored as the founder of the Shafii school of thought. Imam al Shafii was renowned for his structured and analytical approach to Islamic jurisprudence. He studied under both Imam Malik and the students of Imam Abu Hanifa, and through his scholarship, he sought to reconcile differing legal methodologies. He emphasized the importance of four main sources of law: the Quran, the Sunnah of the Prophet, the consensus of the scholars, and analogical reasoning. Imam al Shafii's writings formed the foundation of Islamic legal theory and earned him recognition as a master of both Hadith and Fiqh. He was known for his humility, clarity of thought, and respectful dialogue with other scholars. His approach helped reduce conflicts between differing schools of thought by offering a balanced methodology. Imam al Shafii died in 820 CE in Egypt, where his grave remains a place of respect and remembrance.",

    name: "Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal",
    description:
      "Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal was born in 780 CE in Baghdad, Iraq, and is best known as the founder of the Hanbali school of thought. He was a leading scholar of Hadith and compiled the Musnad, a massive collection of authentic sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad. Imam Ahmad devoted his life to preserving the purity of Islamic beliefs and was known for his unwavering commitment to the Quran and Sunnah. During a time of great political and theological turmoil, he stood firm against attempts by the ruling Abbasid caliphs to impose the doctrine that the Quran was a created entity. Despite being imprisoned, beaten, and subjected to severe torture, Imam Ahmad refused to renounce his beliefs, and his perseverance inspired countless others. He remained steadfast in his devotion to God and continued to teach and write even in times of great personal hardship. Imam Ahmad passed away in 855 CE. The Hanbali school is characterized by its strict adherence to the texts of the Quran and Hadith and is regarded as the most textually conservative among the four major Sunni schools. He is remembered for his humility, moral courage, and profound legacy in the preservation of Islamic tradition.",
